"It is an ambush!" you shout.

Startled, Reginold springs off the ground like a jackrabbit, his chain armor jingling.

Just then, out of the brush rush several snarling goblins, their eyes glowing green in the murky darkness
They charge with their short spears.

/*/"Dive! They have bows!" you shout aas you fling yourself down onto the hard dirt path.

"Wha?" Reginold looks back. "Who has bows?"

Just then, out of the brush rush several snarling goblins, their eyes glowing green in the murky darkness.
They surrounded you in no time and charge with their short spears. With his sword at the ready, reginold steps 
forward to meet the first of them.

/*/When in doubt, hiding is a fine strategy. And the forest offers plenty of cover.

You motion to Reginold as you creep off the trail. Now inside the brush. you can see glowing eyes staring at you
from behind the tree several paces away. You hear a snort as several green-skinned goblins charge out of hiding 
towards you.

/*/"No need to panic yet." you think. You grab Reginold by the shoulder and gesture for him to be quiet

The two of you stand motionless for a few long seconds. Whoosh, a spear grazes you and does 5 Damage. You hear 
a low wheezing sort of breathing. Reginold must have heard it, too, because he raises his sword defensively.

A series of snorts is followed by several goblins with green-tinted skin charging out of hiding toward you.
