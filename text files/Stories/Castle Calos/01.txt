You are an adventurer seeking treasure and glory. You are walking along a path in the forest
on day's journey from Kalas City, your beloved home. Night has just fallen and you're thinking 
about how it might be a good idea to find a campsite. After all, you're in goblin territory, and it's
dangerous to travel in the dark.

Suddenly, you smell something awful.

"Reginold! Are you responsible for that outrageous smell?" you ask the warrior striding ahead of you.

"Pray no! I am always downwind from my companions when I squeeze the bellows." Reginold answers.

You realize that you have never encountered this stench before, and it's close... and, perhaps it's 
your imagination, but is that muffled breathing you just heard?

What do you do?
